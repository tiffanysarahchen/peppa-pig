Random Forest Classifier

random_forest_classifier:
File contains the code that runs a machine learning random forest classifier model
on data collected on an accelerometer. Input data includes linear acceleration on 
the x, y, and z axis. The code fits the model using various statistics, 
machine-learning, and number theory calculations.

data_visualization_code:
File contains the code that shows how visualization graphs were created to model
and see the relationship and fit of each independent variable that went into the 
model.

train_time_series:
CSV file that contains all the time indicators alongside each measurement of 
linear acceleration upon x, y, and z axis needed to fit the training set

train_labels.csv:
CSV file that contains all the time indicators wanted for each activity label
prediction. File also contains all the label indicators for the training set

test_time_series.csv:
CSV file that contains all the time indicators alongside each measurement of 
linear acceleration upon x, y, and z axis needed to fit model to make predictions

test_labels.csv:
CSV file that contains all the time indicators wanted for each activity label
prediction.

test_predictions.csv:
CSV file that contains all the output activity labels predicted by the model
